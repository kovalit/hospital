# All the capistrano stuff moved to '.capistrano' dir using Capfile's :deploy_config_path and :stage_config_path variables.
# Included '.capistrano/tasks/submodule_strategy.rb' provides submodule support.
# Minor hack allows to specify required branch as a shell enviroment variable.
# :deploy_to directory variable is specified in a stage file, so you can deploy several stages on the same server. Or not.
# Stages here are development environment tiers, like "qa", "production", etc.
# Custom stages can be configured in '.capistrano/deploy/' dir.

# Install capistrano:
$ gem install capistrano

# Deploy:
$ cap qa deploy

# For specific branch:
$ BRANCH="branch1" cap qa deploy

# Rollback:
$ cap qa deploy:rollback

# vim: set filetype=sh:
